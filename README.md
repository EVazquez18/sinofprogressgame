# Sin of Progress Game
This is the website for the text-based adventure game, Sin of Progress. This is a project I am currently working on for Digital Media Production at Florida Polytechnic University with my team including: Chandler Hill, Fabrio Volpato, and Leon Lu. The character art is designed and illustrated by Olivia Junghans. I am using the theme Exigo from Theme Wagon.
